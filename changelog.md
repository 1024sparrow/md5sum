# Changelog for 1024sparrow/md5sum

## version 0.1: 
calculate and save md5 for all files in current directory (recursively), list all subdirectories in file md5sum.detalized.txt. Calculate md5 sum of md5sum.detalized.txt and save it in file md5sum.txt
There is not --help support and any arguments. Currently it is possible only analize current directory for summary md5.

## version 0.0 (at the moment of forking): md5 only for hardcoded example.
